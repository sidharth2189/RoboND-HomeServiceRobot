PGM Map File
The map ROS AMCL Package uses a pgm file. A pgm file is a grayscale image file. 
For more information about pgm file or more generally, pnm file, please refer to Netpbm format Wiki Page(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm#File_formats).

By default, AMCL package will treat 'darker' pixels as obstacle in the pgm map file, and 'lighter' pixels as free space. The threshold could be set as a parameter which we will cover when we are building the launch file.
