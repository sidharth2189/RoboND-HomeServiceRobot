Summary of Tasks
In this project, simulatneous localization and mapping on custom robot and its environment is done using rtabmaps.

my_robot:

1) Create a ROS package that launches a custom robot model in a custom Gazebo world
For this purpose, reuse robot from previous project. (https://github.com/sidharth2189/RoboND-WhereAmI).
2) After setting up simulation environment, use the teleop node for robot navigation in the world. 
Note that the environment should have clear features and geometric shapes to perform mapping.
3) Utilize the rtabmap ROS package to perform SLAM.
4) Generate 3D map and analyse database using rtabmap-databaseViewer.
