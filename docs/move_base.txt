# move_base

Using move_base package one can define a navigation goal position for robot in the map, and the robot will navigate to that goal position. Note that this step is optional if one chooses to use teleop node to control and localize robot.

The move_base package is a very powerful tool. It utilizes a costmap - where each part of the map is divided into which area is occupied, like walls or obstacles, and which area is unoccupied. As the robot moves around, a local costmap, in relation to the global costmap, keeps getting updated allowing the package to define a continuous path for the robot to move along.

What makes this package more remarkable is that it has some built-in corrective behaviors or maneuvers. Based on specific conditions, like detecting a particular obstacle or if the robot is stuck, it will navigate the robot around the obstacle or rotate the robot till it finds a clear path ahead.

# Add Parameters to move_base Node
Similar to the amcl node, move_base node requires a set of parameters to move the robot in the world. The param tag can be used to specify the parameter. But when there are plenty of parameters, the rosparam tag is used to include config files to set multiple parameters directly!

Below is the link to all parameters for move_base node.
