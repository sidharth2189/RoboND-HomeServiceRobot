Summary of Tasks
In this project, robot localization is done using adaptive Monte Carlo in ROS

my_robot:

1) Create a ROS package that launches a custom robot model in a custom Gazebo world
For this purpose, reuse robot from previous project. (https://github.com/sidharth2189/RoboND-GoChaseIt).
2) After setting up simulation environment, generate ground truth map from gazebo world using pgm_map_creator.
3) Utilize the ROS AMCL package and the Tele-Operation / Navigation Stack to localize the robot.
4) Explore, add, and tune specific parameters corresponding to each package to achieve the best possible localization results.
